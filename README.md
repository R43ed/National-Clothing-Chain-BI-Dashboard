# National-Clothing-Chain-BI-Dashboard

*Project Instructions*
In this project, you will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.

*Draw conclusions*
Draw conclusions from your analysis and use visuals to answer the following questions:

Analysis Questions:

- What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
- What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
- What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales?
- Which customer do you predict has the highest income?
- Which product will be advertised the most?
  
# Present your analysis
You'll need to submit a 1-to-2-page written summary report in either Word or PDF format. Additionally, you are required to provide a PowerBI (.pbix) file containing all the imported data, formulas, and visualizations that support your summary report. Ensure that the PowerBI report includes a page where you plot three visuals for cross-filtering:

Histogram: Income Distribution
Heat map: Household Income by Location
Scatterplot with trendline: Correlation between average household income by state and average 6-month sales by state.
Include a card displaying the correlation coefficient (R^2 value).
Use other visuals as needed on additional pages to further present the results of your analysis.

# Histogram
Although you will need to determine the parameters of the histogram(s) for your project, think about what a histogram is intended to do. In the example below, you can see that the histogram gives you a clear understanding of the distribution of values and helps you visualize the shape of the data. We can see here that it's a right-skewed distribution with a peak of around $40k and an average that is probably a bit to the right of the peak.

Your histogram(s) should also convey important statistics about the data you analyze, so you'll probably want to have at minimum 4 columns but preferably more.

Additionally, although there is a histogram visual you can download from the Power BI marketplace (if you have access to that resource) it's recommended that you use a column chart instead so that you can use a DAX formula to specify the ranges and number of columns (more on this in the detailed instructions).
